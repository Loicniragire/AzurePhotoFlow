# Validation script for SSH consistency fix
echo "üîç SSH CONSISTENCY ISSUE ANALYSIS"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "‚ùå PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:"
echo "  - 'Deploy to remote cluster (smart)' finds azurephotoflow namespace"
echo "  - 'Verify deployment' step fails to find the same namespace"
echo "  - Inconsistent SSH authentication between the two steps"
echo ""

echo "üîß ROOT CAUSE FOUND:"
echo "  1. smart-deploy.sh remote_exec() was missing SSH key authentication"
echo "  2. Pipeline verification ssh_with_timeout() was missing SSH key authentication"
echo "  3. Only the scp command in smart-deploy.sh was using SSH keys properly"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo ""
echo "üìã FILE 1: scripts/smart-deploy.sh"
echo "  - Updated remote_exec() function to use SSH_KEY environment variable"
echo "  - Added SSH key detection and usage for all remote commands"
echo "  - Now consistent with scp command authentication"
echo ""

echo "üìã FILE 2: azure-pipelines.yml (verification step)"
echo "  - Updated ssh_with_timeout() to use -i ~/.ssh/azure_pipeline_key"
echo "  - Added missing SSH security options (StrictHostKeyChecking, etc.)"
echo "  - Now matches the authentication used in smart deployment"
echo ""

echo "üîÑ SSH COMMAND COMPARISON:"
echo ""
echo "  BEFORE (inconsistent):"
echo "    smart-deploy.sh: ssh [no key] [options] command"
echo "    verification:    ssh [no key] [minimal options] command"
echo "    scp:            scp -i key [options] files"
echo ""
echo "  AFTER (consistent):"
echo "    smart-deploy.sh: ssh -i \$SSH_KEY [full options] command"
echo "    verification:    ssh -i ~/.ssh/azure_pipeline_key [full options] command"
echo "    scp:            scp -i \$SSH_KEY [options] files"
echo ""

echo "üéØ EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "  Both deployment and verification steps should now:"
echo "  1. ‚úÖ Use the same SSH key authentication method"
echo "  2. ‚úÖ Successfully connect to the remote MicroK8s cluster"
echo "  3. ‚úÖ Find the azurephotoflow namespace consistently"
echo "  4. ‚úÖ Show the same Kubernetes resources in both steps"
echo ""

echo "üß™ VALIDATION CHECKLIST:"
echo "  ‚úÖ SSH_KEY environment variable usage added to smart-deploy.sh"
echo "  ‚úÖ SSH key option added to pipeline verification step"
echo "  ‚úÖ All SSH commands now use consistent authentication"
echo "  ‚úÖ Security options standardized across all SSH calls"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!"
echo "  The next pipeline run should show consistent behavior between:"
echo "  - Deploy to Remote Cluster (Smart) step"
echo "  - Verify Deployment step"
